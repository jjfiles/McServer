# Installation

## Forge

You should see this window:

Ensure that `install client` is selected and press ok. **Do not** change the file location.

# Mod Overview

## Optimization

### Clumps

Clumps changes the behavior of exp orbs, this is mainly for server performance

### Entity Culling

This allows entities (think chests and mobs), to not render if they are not in view of a player.

Keep in mind that if a player is in range the entity will still exist and behave as normal, It will just only load visually if it can be directly seen by a player

### LeavesBeGone

Greatly increases the rate at which leaves despawn after a tree is chopped down, all of the drops are the same as they would have been

### Optifine

Tons of client and server optimizations for lag/fps as well as allowing shaders and other cosmetic things

### Configured

Allows mod configuration for some mods in game instead of having to open the files


## UI

### JEI/JER (Just Enough Inventory/Resources)

When inside of your inventory there will be a pannel on the right where you can search for any item in the game. Clicking on an item will show you how to craft it or where to get it.

You can also bookmark items (default keybind is `a`)

`r` will also show you the recipe

`u` should show you what an item can be used in

Double-Clicking or `Crtl + f` will highlight the search bar

### JourneyMap

Gives a minimap and a fullscreen map. Allows for waypoints

`n` pulls up waypoints

`b` creates a waypoint at your location ***I highly recommend changing this keybind*** 

`j` opens the fullscreen map

### StylishEffects
